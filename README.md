# Wordle 

### What is Wordle?
Wordle is a daily word game which asks users to guess 
a 5-letter word and gives hints to reach to the correct
guess.

### What's this solution?
This solution is a simple java class to help solve Wordle 
puzzle online.

The users need to play the first round on Worlde UI where
they submit the first guess and get a feedback. As a next step,
users need to submit the guess and feedback shown by wordle UI
to the program. The program then suggests 10 potential words 
for next round.

```
Enter input: INDIA
Enter feedback (X -> Gray/White, Y -> yellow, G -> green): GYXXX
Suggestion(s):
ICING
ICONS
IKONS
IMINE
IMINO
IPPON
IRING
IRONE
IRONS
IRONY
```
